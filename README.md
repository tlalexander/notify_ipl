Add this to your .bashrc file to be notified every week when you need to do [IPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intense_pulsed_light).
I chose a 6 day period so I have a heads up one day early.
You should also create an alias. For example I added these lines:

alias ipl="python3 /home/taylor/Software/notify_ipl/notify_ipl.py"
 
python3 /home/taylor/Software/notify_ipl/notify_ipl.py -q
